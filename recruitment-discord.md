# üöÄ SchedShare QA Testing - Need Your Help!

Hey everyone!

I've been building **SchedShare** - a web app that converts course schedule PDFs into calendar events (Google Calendar, Outlook, Apple Calendar, etc.). Think "upload PDF ‚Üí automatic calendar events" instead of manually typing everything.

## Quick Ask
Looking for **10-15 volunteers** to help QA test before wider release. Takes ~15 minutes, and I think you'll find it genuinely useful.

**For Students**: Perfect for getting your semester schedule into your calendar quickly
**For Faculty**: Works great for Outlook integration if you have similar PDF schedules to students (I believe that you do!)

## What You'd Test
‚úÖ PDF upload & course extraction (Use a previous VIU course schedule PDF or a sample document I provide) 
‚úÖ Calendar integration (Google/ICS download for Outlook/Apple)  
‚úÖ Overall user experience & edge cases  
‚úÖ Cross-browser compatibility  

## Tech Stack (for the curious)
Simple Bootstrap frontend, Flask backend, PDF parsing libraries, Google Calendar API connection. Happy to discuss architecture choices or challenges I've solved.

## What's In It For You?

**Students:**
- Real QA experience for your resume
- Behind-the-scenes look at full-stack development process
- Early access to something that'll save time each semester
- Optional: Tim's gift cards or group pizza üçï

**Faculty:**
- See a student project from concept to testing
- Potential tool for your own schedule management
- Insight into current student development practices

## Testing Process
1. I'll send you a testing guide & feedback form
2. Test on your preferred device/browser  
3. Quick feedback survey
4. Optional 5-min chat about experience

## Why I'm Sharing This Here
As CSCI folks, we all know testing is crucial but rarely see it in practice on real projects. This is a chance to contribute to both student life improvement AND see a complete software development cycle.

Plus, if this works well, it could save every VIU student 10+ minutes every semester. That's a lot of collective time back in everyone's hands.

## Interested?
Drop me a DM with:
- Student/Faculty
- Year level (if student)
- Preferred testing device/browser
- Best way to coordinate timing (I plan on building a tool for this as my next calendar related app!)

## Professional Note
This project represents a month or two of development work spread over the last 2 semesters including requirements gathering, architecture design, API integration, and user experience design. I'm actively seeking internship/junior dev opportunities and would welcome any connections or advice from faculty who might know of relevant openings.

**Timeline**: Testing will only take an hour or two from start to finish.

Thanks for reading! Even if you can't test, I'm always happy to chat about the technical challenges, architecture decisions, or development process. This has been an amazing learning experience in PDF parsing, calendar APIs, and user-centered design.
