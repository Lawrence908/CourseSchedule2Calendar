# ðŸš€ Help Test SchedShare - A Student Schedule Tool (QA Volunteers Needed!)

Hey fellow CSCI students! ðŸ‘‹

I've been working on a project called **SchedShare** that I think could genuinely make our lives easier. It's a web app that takes your course schedule PDF (the one you download from student services) and automatically converts it into calendar events for Google Calendar, Apple Calendar, or any calendar app.

## What I Need Help With
I'm looking for **10-15 CSCI students** to help me QA test this before I release it to the broader student body. Testing should take about **10-15 minutes** of your time, and I'll provide everything you need.

## What You'll Test
- Upload your course schedule PDF (or I can provide sample ones)
- See how well it extracts your courses, times, and locations
- Try the calendar integration features
- Give feedback on the user experience

## What's In It For You? 

### Option 1: Learning & Portfolio Building
- **Behind-the-scenes project insights**: I'll share my full development process, architecture decisions, and testing strategy document
- **Real-world QA experience**: Perfect for your resume and understanding software testing workflows  
- **Tech stack deep-dive**: I'm using React, Node.js, PDF parsing libraries, and calendar APIs - happy to discuss any of it
- **Project planning exposure**: See how I organized features, timelines, and user testing (great for your own projects)

### Option 2: Small Incentives
- Tim Hortons gift cards ($10-15) for thorough testing and feedback
- Pizza lunch for the group after testing is complete

### Option 3: Just Being Awesome
- Help make student life a bit easier for everyone at VIU
- Get early access to a tool that might actually save you time each semester
- Contribute to a fellow student's project success

## How Testing Works
1. I'll send you a testing guide and feedback form
2. Test the app on your preferred device/browser
3. Fill out a quick feedback survey
4. Optional: Brief 5-minute chat about your experience

## What I'm Looking For
- Mix of different year levels (2nd year to grad students)
- Various comfort levels with tech (beginners welcome!)
- Different devices/browsers if possible
- Honest feedback (seriously, I want to know what breaks)

## Interested?
Drop me a message with:
- Your year level
- Preferred device/browser for testing  
- Which incentive option appeals to you (or if you're just being helpful)
- Best way to reach you for testing coordination

## Why This Matters
As CSCI students, we know how important user testing is, but we rarely get to see it in action on real projects. This is a chance to contribute to both student life improvement AND see a complete software development cycle from the inside.

Plus, if this works well, it could save every student at VIU 10-15 minutes every semester converting their schedules to calendars manually. That's a lot of collective time saved!

Thanks for considering it! Even if you can't test, feel free to ask me about the project - I'm always happy to chat about the technical challenges and solutions.

**Contact**: [Your preferred contact method]
**Timeline**: Testing starts next week, wraps up in 2-3 weeks

*P.S. - If you're curious about the tech stack or want to see some code, I'm happy to share. This has been a great learning project for PDF parsing, calendar APIs, and user experience design.*
